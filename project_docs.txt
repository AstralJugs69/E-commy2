# Project Documentation: Hybrid E-commerce Platform (Comprehensive)
*(Generated: 2025-05-27 - End of Session on refactor/code-polish-v2)*

## 1. Current Progress

Work commenced on the `feature/customer-address-management` branch (merged or state incorporated into `main`) and continued on the `refactor/code-polish-v2` branch for polish, fixes, and deployment setup.

### 1.1 Refactor/Polish Phase (Branch: `refactor/code-polish-v2`)

**Goal:** Address technical debt, UX polish items, add i18n foundation, and deploy the application to Render.com.

**Branch:** `refactor/code-polish-v2` (branched from main)

**Status:** Core refactors, fixes, i18n setup, and Render deployment configuration completed. The application is deployed on Render's free tier. Further polish and i18n translation can continue.

**Completed on this branch:**

*   **Backend - Phone Assignment:** Fixed potential race condition by moving phone number assignment (`Available` -> `Busy`) into the atomic `POST /api/orders` transaction. Removed the separate `GET /api/orders/assign-number/:orderId` route. Added `assignedPhoneNumberId` relation to `Order` model (Migration applied). (L13, L28)
*   **Customer FE - Order Success Page:** Refined page to fetch and display the *specific* assigned verification phone number (as a `tel:` link) from order details, improving clarity. Removed generic reminder text.
*   **FE - Image URL Handling:** Created `getImageUrl` utility functions in both Customer and Admin frontends to consistently handle image path construction (prepending API base URL for relative paths, using absolute URLs directly, providing placeholders). Updated components (`ProductCard`, `ProductDetailPage`, `CartPage`, `WishlistPage`, Admin tables/details) to use this utility. (L23)
*   **Customer FE - Product Detail Page:** Implemented `react-bootstrap Carousel` to display multiple product images. Adjusted layout to improve visibility of Add-to-Cart button and resized "Back to Products" button.
*   **Customer FE - Cart Page:** Fixed quantity adjustment logic using +/- buttons and context function, respecting stock/min limits. Removed direct input field.
*   **Backend - Rate Limiting:** Adjusted `express-rate-limit` settings. Shortened general/write windows to 40s with adjusted limits (50/20). Increased login attempts slightly (15 per 15min). Verified stricter limits remain for password reset/register.
*   **Admin FE - Password Change:** Added "Profile Settings" page (`/admin/profile`) allowing logged-in admins to change their own password (requires current password). Refactored Admin FE Auth to use `AuthContext`.
*   **Customer FE - Password Change:** Added "Security" tab to Settings page (`/settings`) allowing logged-in customers to change their own password (requires current password).
*   **Customer FE - Checkout Location:** Implemented Delivery Location selection dropdown on Checkout page. Added modal (`Add New Location`) to create new locations during checkout (using `POST /api/addresses`). Updated order submission (`POST /api/orders`) to send `deliveryLocationId`. Fetches districts for dropdown via `GET /api/districts`.
*   **Customer FE - PWA Enhancements:** Added `PWAPrompt` component using `useRegisterSW` to handle update notifications (toast with refresh button). Added manual "Install App" button to Layout Navbar, triggered by `beforeinstallprompt` event. Added necessary PWA icons (`192x192`, `512x512`, `apple-touch-icon`, `favicon`) to `/public` folder. Verified basic installability and update prompt.
*   **Admin FE - Category Image Upload:** Modified Category modal to use file upload via existing `/api/admin/upload` endpoint (using 'productImages' field name). Backend processes to WebP. Category CRUD now uses the returned image URL.
*   **UI Consistency - Buttons:** Standardized button variants and sizes within Customer FE and Admin FE according to their respective themes and action types. (L10, L24)
*   **UI Consistency - Forms (Admin FE):** Standardized labels, input padding, spacing, and feedback display across admin forms/modals.
*   **UI Consistency - Forms (Customer FE):** Standardized labels, input padding, spacing, and feedback display across customer forms/modals.
*   **Backend - Compression:** Added `compression` middleware to `index.ts` to enable gzip/brotli response compression.
*   **i18n Setup (Customer FE):** Installed necessary libraries, configured `i18n.ts`, created placeholder locale files (`en`, `am`, `om`), added language switcher UI, internationalized `Layout.tsx`. (Full i18n refactor of other components deferred).
*   **Deployment to Render.com:**
    *   Deployed PostgreSQL (Free Tier - **WARNING: 90-day data limit**).
    *   Created multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` for backend.
    *   Deployed Backend as Docker Web Service (Free Tier - Sleeps). Configured build commands (`npm install --production=false`), start commands (`npx prisma migrate deploy && ...`). Configured ENV VARS (`DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `NODE_ENV`, `CORS_ORIGIN`).
    *   Deployed Customer Frontend as Static Site. Configured `VITE_API_URL`.
    *   Deployed Admin Frontend as Static Site. Configured `VITE_API_URL`.
    *   Resolved deployment issues (missing types, migration execution, frontend API URL).

**Next Steps / Deferred:**

*   Complete i18n refactoring across all Customer FE components/pages.
*   Obtain and implement actual Amharic/Oromo translations.
*   Further UI/UX Polish (Feedback consistency, focus states, mobile responsiveness tuning, microcopy).
*   Accessibility: Perform manual checks and address minor findings.
*   Testing: Increase test coverage (backend integration, frontend components/flows).
*   Consider migrating Render free tier DB to a permanent solution (e.g., Neon, paid Render plan) before the 90-day limit.
*   Consider upgrading Render backend service to prevent sleeping if required for production use.


### 1.2 Completed: Customer Address Management Foundation

*(Details moved from previous Current Focus)*

**Goal:** Allow authenticated customers to save, edit, delete, and set default delivery locations on their profile (Settings page) and select a saved location during checkout.

**Branch:** Work done on `feature/customer-address-management` (merged or state incorporated into `main` before `refactor/code-polish-v2` branch). Integration into Checkout completed on `refactor/code-polish-v2`.

**Progress:**
- Refactored Prisma Schema (Address -> DeliveryLocation), Migrated.
- Added `/api/districts` endpoint.
- Refactored `/api/addresses` routes for DeliveryLocation CRUD.
- Refactored `POST /api/orders` to use `deliveryLocationId`.
- Implemented Location selection/add modal in `CheckoutPage.tsx`.
- Implemented Location management UI in `SettingsPage.tsx`.


### 1.3 Completed: Multiple Product Images

*(From previous docs)* The project supports multiple product images.
- Updated DB schema (`imageUrl` -> `images` relation).
- Updated Backend API.
- Updated Admin FE Product Form.
- Updated Customer FE components (ProductCard, DetailPage, Cart, Wishlist).


### 1.4 Completed: Initial Refactor/Review Phase

*(From previous docs - `refactor/code-review-performance-ux` branch, merged to main)*
- Added DB Indexes.
- Standardized API calls.
- Optimized Backend List Queries.
- Frontend Optimizations (`react-icons`, `React.lazy` for Admin FE).
- Admin Zone Map fix.
- General aesthetics pass (spacing, alignment, consistency).
- Settings page UX refinement.
- Order status descriptions added.
- Basic rate limiting on backend auth.
- Minor UX improvements (Order Success page).
- Admin Dashboard order section refactor.

## 2. Project Summary & Vision

### 2.1. Core Concept
Hybrid E-commerce Platform for businesses needing manual phone verification after online order placement. Mobile-first customer frontend (React PWA) + Admin Panel (React).

### 2.2. Unique Workflow
1.  Customer browses/adds to cart (React PWA).
2.  Checkout: provides delivery details (selects/adds DeliveryLocation), geolocation potentially captured.
3.  Order Submission (`POST /api/orders`):
    *   Validates data, delivery location.
    *   **Atomically (within DB transaction):**
        *   Finds and assigns an available `PhoneNumber` (marks as 'Busy', stores ID on Order). *If none available, transaction fails.*
        *   Checks stock. *If insufficient, transaction fails.*
        *   Performs optional location check (Turf.js) against `ServiceArea` polygons (if enabled).
        *   Saves Order, OrderItems.
        *   Decrements stock.
    *   Returns Order ID on success.
4.  Redirect to Order Success Page: Displays Order ID and the **assigned verification phone number** (fetched from order details). Instructs user to call.
5.  Admin Panel: Manage Products, Categories (with image uploads), Delivery Locations (via map?), Phone Numbers (status), Orders (view details, map, update status), Users, Zones (map drawing), Dashboard/Stats. Manual phone verification updates order status via Admin Panel.

### 2.3. Problem Solved
Bridges manual/phone orders and full e-commerce. Caters to businesses needing verification, delivery checks, or direct contact.

## 3. Goals

### 3.1. Business Goals
*   Increase Order Volume, Improve Accuracy, Enhance Control, Manage Service Areas, Build Credibility, Efficient Verification.

### 3.2. Customer Experience (UX) Goals (Mobile-First Priority)
*   Intuitive Browsing/Search/Filter, Seamless Cart/Checkout (with Delivery Location selection), Clear Post-Order Flow (with specific verification #), Account Management (Profile, Orders, Wishlist, Delivery Locations), Mobile Optimization, Performance, PWA Installability/Updates.

### 3.3. Admin Experience (UX) Goals
*   Efficient Workflows (CRUD, Order processing, Zone management), Data Clarity (Tables, Maps, Stats), Ease of Management.

### 3.4. Technical Goals
*   Reliability (Atomic transactions), Security (Hashing, JWT, Validation, CORS, Rate Limiting), Performance (Responsive API, Optimized FE builds, DB Indexing, Image Optimization), Maintainability (Monorepo, TS, Docs, Tests), Scalability (Stateless API, Cloud DB option).

## 5. Development Log, Key Decisions & Issues (Reflects `refactor/code-polish-v2`)

*   (Inherited logs from previous states...)
*   **Branch `refactor/code-polish-v2` created** from main for polish/refactoring.
*   **Fixed Phone Assignment Race Condition:** Moved assignment logic into `POST /api/orders` transaction. Added `assignedPhoneNumberId` to `Order` model. Removed separate assignment endpoint. (L13, L28)
*   **Refined Order Success Page:** Updated Customer FE page to fetch and display the specific assigned verification number from order details. Improved clarity.
*   **Standardized Image URL Handling:** Created `getImageUrl` utility in both FEs. Updated components (`ProductCard`, `ProductDetailPage`, `CartPage`, `WishlistPage`, admin pages) to use it. Ensures correct base URL prepending. (L23)
*   **Improved Product Detail Page:** Added `react-bootstrap/Carousel` for multiple images. Adjusted layout for better visibility of 'Add to Cart'.
*   **Fixed Cart Quantity Controls:** Implemented +/- buttons correctly using `updateCartItemQuantity` from context, respecting stock/min limits. Removed direct input field.
*   **Adjusted Rate Limiting:** Tuned limits in backend (`general`, `write`, `auth`) for better balance between UX and abuse prevention.
*   **Added In-App Password Change:** Implemented forms and backend logic (`POST /api/auth/change-password`) for logged-in users (Customer & Admin) to change their password via Settings/Profile pages, requiring current password.
*   **Refactored Admin FE Auth:** Implemented `AuthContext` for admin frontend, replacing direct localStorage usage in components like `ProtectedRoute`, `AdminLayout`, `LoginPage`.
*   **Implemented Checkout Location Selection:** Added dropdown and Add New modal to Customer FE Checkout page. Integrated with `DeliveryLocation` model and updated `POST /api/orders`.
*   **Enhanced PWA:** Added manual install button, update prompt (`PWAPrompt` component), and required icons for better PWA installability and update experience on Customer FE.
*   **Enabled Category Image Upload:** Modified Admin FE Category modal to allow file uploads (using existing `/api/admin/upload` route) instead of just URL input. Backend processes to WebP.
*   **Standardized UI:** Applied consistent button variants/sizes and form element styles within both Customer FE and Admin FE according to their respective themes.
*   **Backend - Compression:** Added `compression` middleware.
*   **i18n Setup (Customer FE):** Installed necessary libraries, configured `i18n.ts`, created placeholder locale files (`en`, `am`, `om`), added language switcher UI, internationalized `Layout.tsx`. Deferred full component refactoring.
*   **Containerized Backend:** Created `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` for the backend service.
*   **Deployed to Render.com:** Configured PostgreSQL DB, Backend Docker Web Service, Customer Static Site, Admin Static Site. Configured build/start commands, environment variables. Successfully ran initial migrations via start script. Resolved deployment issues (missing types, migration execution, frontend API URL ENV VARs, CORS).

## 6. Lessons Learned (Cumulative)

*   L1: Validate AI Output Rigorously.
*   L2: Explicit Instructions are Key.
*   L3: Manual Steps are Critical (Git, npm, migrations, testing, ENV VARS).
*   L4: Maintain Project Context (`project_docs.txt`).
*   L5: Prioritize Backend/Foundations (MVP).
*   L6: Visual Feedback Loop (User validation for UI).
*   L7: Manage Async Operations Carefully (Loading/Error states, Toasts).
*   L8: Component Design & Boundaries (Context API benefits).
*   L9: Frontend State Management Strategy (Context vs. Local).
*   L10: Styling Strategy & Consistency (Bootstrap + Custom CSS).
*   L11: API Design & Consistency.
*   L12: Database Schema Evolution (Use migrations systematically).
*   L13: Backend Data Integrity & Transactions (Order/Stock/Phone).
*   L14: Configuration & Environment Management (`.env`, Render Vars).
*   L15: Build & Tooling Integration (Vite, TS, `npm` workspaces, `rollup-plugin-visualizer`).
*   L16: Debugging Strategies (DevTools, Logs, API testing, Manual Test).
*   L17: Code Cleanup & Refactoring.
*   L18: Security Fundamentals (Hashing, JWT, Validation, Rate Limiting, CORS).
*   L19: Handling Complex Features (Geolocation, PWA, File Uploads, i18n).
*   L20: Mobile-First / Responsive Design.
*   L21: Data Model/API Change Impact (Frontend updates needed).
*   L22: Build/Dependency Cache Issues (Clean install, `prisma generate`).
*   L23: Frontend/Backend URL Handling (`getImageUrl` utility, `VITE_API_URL`).
*   L24: Iterative UI Refinement (Button/Form Consistency).
*   L25: Deployment Configuration (Render specifics: env vars, `migrate deploy`, start cmd).
*   L26: Environment-Specific CORS (Crucial for production).
*   L27: Feature Branch Scope.
*   L28: Business Logic Integrity & Transactions (Phone assignment fix).
*   L29: Reusable Components (`LinkButton`, `getImageUrl`, `EmptyState`, `StarRating`).
*   L30: Explicit Prop Handling.
*   L31: PWA Setup: Requires icons, manifest, SW (`vite-plugin-pwa`). Install depends on browser heuristics. Test build/preview. Use `beforeinstallprompt` for manual trigger. `autoUpdate` strategy needs refresh prompt UI.
*   L32: i18n Setup: `i18next` good structure. Needs config, locale files (`/public/locales`), component refactoring (`t()` function). AI translation needs human review. Use `Suspense` for loading states.
*   L33: Docker for Node/Prisma: Multi-stage builds best. Include `prisma generate` in build. `prisma migrate deploy` needed at runtime start on limited platforms (like Render Free). Install *all* deps (`--production=false`) before build if devDeps needed. Use `.dockerignore`.
*   L34: Deployment Platform Specifics: Free tiers have limits (sleep, DB deletion, no shell). Workarounds needed (migrations in start command). Check build commands (`--production=false`). Set ENV VARS correctly (`DATABASE_URL`, `VITE_API_URL`, `CORS_ORIGIN`).
*   L35: Runtime Env Var Check: Use `console.log(import.meta.env.VAR_NAME)` in deployed frontend build to verify env vars are correctly passed during build/deployment.
*   L36: CORS Configuration: Must exactly match frontend origins in production ENV VAR, comma-separated, no trailing slashes.
