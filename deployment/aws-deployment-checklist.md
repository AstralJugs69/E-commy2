- [x] Ensure database connection handles AWS RDS properly

## 4. Frontend Build Optimizations
- [x] Update Vite configs for production builds
- [x] Ensure frontend correctly handles API endpoints via environment variables

## 5. Deployment Preparation
- [x] Create AWS deployment script
- [x] Update README with AWS deployment instructions
