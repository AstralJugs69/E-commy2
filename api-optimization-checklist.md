## Progress Notes
- Created optimization checklist to track improvements
- Implemented caching middleware with different strategies:
  - Static cache (1 hour) for rarely changing resources like categories
  - Dynamic cache (5 minutes) for product listings
  - Private cache for user-specific resources
  - ETag middleware for conditional requests
- Created aggregated endpoints:
  - Homepage data combining featured products, categories and new products
  - Product details endpoint that includes reviews and related products
  - User profile endpoint that combines profile, orders, and delivery addresses
- Implemented batch cart operations to reduce multiple API calls
- Enhanced frontend API client with:
  - Client-side request caching for improved performance
  - Request deduplication to prevent duplicate requests
  - ETag support for conditional requests
  - Request cancellation for abandoned components
- Updated HomePage component to use the optimized homepage endpoint
- Added standardized pagination format across all list endpoints
- Implemented WebSocket integration for real-time order updates
- Added field selection utility to allow API clients to specify which fields they want returned
